click on "terrorist_plans_in_minecraft.7z" above, then click on the download icon on the right.

once downloaded, unzip it. place the resulting folder (called terrorism_plans_in_minecraft) into /home/USERNAME/.mineccraft/resourcepacks for linux, or C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks\terrorism_plans_in_minecraft for windows.

after loading up the game, go to options --> resource packs and then place the pack into the right side on top of the default texture pack. once in a world, press f3+t.

this is my first time doing shit with github, i don't care if I'm doing something wrong. do whatever you wnat with this.
